## Notes

[Source Code for this project](https://github.com/ZachLTech/portfolio-tui)

Thanks for checking out my portfolio TUI and have fun exploring the other features around these parts!

I learned so much making this TUI especially it being my first time writing Go. Props to all the devs out there working at charmbracelet.. Absolutely amazing people and this project wouldn't be possible without them and their great repositories

Also I do plan to make this a modular program with way cleaner implementations once I have the time to so anyone could clone my source code repo and make their own TUI portfolio easily

Project inspired by [soft-serve](https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve) - Try it with `$ ssh git.charm.sh`
