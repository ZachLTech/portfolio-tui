## Overview

Schedulix is an innovative scheduling application developed to assist university students in creating optimal course schedules. This project was developed during the [NightHacks](https://nighthacks.devpost.com/) hackathon, where it won first place in the "Best Advanced Hack" category. 

The application is designed to take user preferences alongside the classes they plan to join into account and generate multiple schedule options that best fit these preferences, offering flexibility and choice. Schedulix was a collaborative effort between my friend Thandi and me, marking our first hackathon experience.

## Development Experience

For Schedulix, I focused on developing the frontend while my friend worked on the backend. Due to time constraints—we had only one day for the entire hackathon—we weren't able to fully integrate the frontend and backend components. Despite this, we successfully demonstrated the potential of our scheduling algorithm and its ability to offer multiple scheduling options based on user inputted preferences.

## Key Features

- **User Preferences**: Allows students to input specific scheduling preferences and generates multiple schedules accordingly.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Provides several schedule options to choose from, accommodating various personal and academic needs.
- **Node.js Backend**: The backend, developed in Node.js, powers the algorithm that creates these schedules.

## Challenges and Achievements

This was my first hackathon, and it was an exciting challenge to create a functioning prototype within such a short timeframe. The experience taught us valuable lessons about rapid development and teamwork. Winning the "Best Advanced Hack" award was a testament to our innovative approach and technical skills.

## Future Improvements

While Schedulix was a great success at the hackathon, there are several features and improvements planned for future development:

- **User Input**: Implementing a more interactive user interface to input preferences dynamically.
- **Integration**: Fully linking the frontend with the backend to provide a seamless user experience.
- **Data Scraping**: Developing a web scraper to fetch course data directly from university websites for real-time scheduling.
- **Expanded Preferences**: Offering more detailed scheduling options to cater to a broader range of student needs.
