## Overview

Devfolify is an innovative full-stack application designed to transform the way developers engage with coding challenges. Developed as a submission for the Illuminate Hackathon, Devfolify aims to provide real-world problem-solving experiences through personalized and skill-level tailored challenges, offering both newcomers and experienced developers a platform to apply their skills creatively.

The main idea behind Devfolify is to offer users challenges based on real-world problems in various industries, encouraging innovative solutions and collaboration. It also functions like a continuous online hackathon where developers can participate in monthly challenges, showcase their solutions, and explore others' projects. This not only aids in skill development but also fosters a community of problem solvers and innovators.

## Development and Collaboration

Devfolify was created during the Illuminate Hackathon with plans for further development to enhance its features and social interaction capabilities. Although developed under tight time constraints, the project successfully laid the foundation for a platform that bridges the gap between abstract coding exercises and practical, impactful problem-solving.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Challenges**: Uses a refined algorithm to offer challenges suited to the userâ€™s skill level, fostering a more engaging and relevant experience.
- **Skill Development**: Encourages users to solve real-world problems, enhancing both technical skills and creative thinking.
- **Express.js Backend**: Robust REST API developed with Express.js for efficient data handling.
- **Nuxt.js Frontend**: A modern interface built with Nuxt.js, offering a seamless user experience (though currently not mobile-supported).
- **TailwindCSS and DaisyUI Styling**: A sleek and functional UI using TailwindCSS and DaisyUI components.
- **Appwrite Authentication**: Secure and reliable user authentication with Appwrite.
- **Docker Support**: Simplified deployment and development environment with full Docker support.
- **Generative AI Integration**: Utilizes googles Gemini LLM to help generate challenges the user must create a solution to 

## Future Enhancements

- **Database Implementation**: To enable user interactions and a social component where users can view and share challenges or solutions.
- **Project Submissions**: Allowing users to submit and share their solutions with the community.
- **Enhanced Dashboard**: Additional features and improvements to the UI for better usability.
- **Challenge Leaderboards**: Public leaderboards to encourage competition and recognize top problem solvers.
- **Implementation Statistics**: Statistics showing if any solutions were implemented in the real world and other user based personal telemetry

## Notes

We ended up winning third place in the competition although many argued and thought we would be first but some judge and result complications arised after submissions so this ended up not being the case.

I hope to one day build this out and if it were to become a real open source platform that people used, I would be beyond happy.
