# About Me

---

Hi! I'm Zach, a passionate computer science enthusiast currently dually enrolled studying CS @ FAU. With a love for innovation and technology, I've explored everything from 3D printing and virtual machines to web development and server management. My journey has been filled with exciting projects and continuous learning, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skills as I've found myself to be a quick learner who enjoys the process of creating new things.

## Technical Journey

Growing up in a small town, I always had an interest for creating new things. From 3D printing and designing in CAD to building hand soldered keyboards and tinkering with virtual machines, my passion for engineering and technology started early ever since I was in Middle school. But High school was a turning point for me, as I moved to pursue my interest in computer science while fully dually enrolled in university.

### Early Projects

I began coding around three years ago, inspired by content creators and an interest for how computers work. I started with Python, where I created projects like:

- **Smart Auto Clicker**: Automated and configurable clicking based on image recognition and input via a tkinter UI.
- **Text Reader Bot**: Automated typing bot for online speed tests.
- **Cryptocurrency Predictor**: A sentiment analysis-based prediction algorithm using PyTorch and Hugging Face models.

Unfortunately, I lost much of my early work due to a lack of version control knowledge, but this setback only fueled my desire to learn more.

### Web Development

My interest in the internet led me to explore web development. I started with HTML and CSS and quickly moved on to JavaScript. My first interactive website calculated the theoretical physical size of the internet if downloaded onto various storage devices, using only raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project laid the groundwork for my journey into frontend frameworks like Svelte and Nuxt, which I now use extensively.

### Homelab & Networking

Driven by the limitations of proprietary online services, I delved into self-hosting. I repurposed old hardware to create my first homelab setup and learned about network management, port forwarding, and VPNs. Once I reached limitations on the 10+ year old hardware I was originally using, I set out to build a new robust server infrastructure after acquiring a rack server with:

- **Proxmox and TrueNAS** for VM management and ZFS Raid storage.
- **Nginx Proxy Manager** and **Cloudflare Tunnel** for securely exposing select services & websites to the public internet.
- **Wireguard VPN** for secure remote access.

### Recent Achievements
Recently, I was part of a team that built a solar-powered car for the Solar Car Challenge held in Texas. I helped in leading the creation of a Tesla-style dashboard interface for the car using a Raspberry Pi and full-stack software developed by me and a few peers, earning first place in engineering design and second place in our division for laps made.

Currently, I'm focused on research in AI funded by FAUs OURI program and developing my personal branding for future opportunities.

## Personal Life & Interests

Outside of engineering, I grew up enjoying the outdoors. With woods and nature all around where I grew up, I spent a lot of time playing with my two dogs and hanging out with neighbors.

Since moving to South Florida for my studies, I've embraced the beach life, hanging out with friends, playing basketball weekly, and exploring new activities like wakeboarding. I also enjoy 3D printing, making model replica swords for fun.

## Looking Ahead

I'm passionate about teaching programming and engineering to others and constantly seek new challenges and projects. In the future, I plan to build a mini jet turbine from scratch as a personal project for fun.
