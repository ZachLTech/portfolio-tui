### About me 👀
Hi, My name’s Zach, Currently I'm a student attending university!
Beyond schooling, I program for fun using coding to my advantage when I get the chance. Full stack devt. has been my focus recently but I'm majoring in computer science and entrepreneurship is the plan.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "Interests": ["Full Stack (Web Devt.)", "Self Hosted", "IT", "Artificial Intelligence", "Data Science"],
  "Learning Focus": ["Go", "Supabase", "Appwrite", "MySQL"],
  "Plan to Learn": ["Stripe", "Blender", "Mojo", "Entrepreneurship 😄"],
}
```

I'm currently working on a few projects, some of which are public in my repositories. Alongside taking college classes full-time, I enjoy ricing my arch system with Hyprland, playing basketball on weekends, messing with CAD / 3D Printing, and building my ultimate proxmox powered homelab (docker is my best friend)

I also like dogs 🐶
